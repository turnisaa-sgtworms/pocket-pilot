epic tiny keeb, so cool.

fits in the 100mm x 100mm jlcpcb coupon requirements! i ordered mine for 12 usd (with tarriffs!)

sub minimum choc spacing - you will have to sacrifice 22x choc switches to sand/file the sides down. you'll also need to 3d print some keycaps (idk if something like the MNT pocket reform keycaps will fit.) my files are included.

more info to come!
